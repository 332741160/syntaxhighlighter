SyntaxHighlighter is THE client side highlighter for the web and web-apps! It's been around since 2004 and it's used virtually everywhere to seamlessly highlight code for presentation purposes.

The history of this project predates majority of the common web technologies and it has been a challenge to dedicate time and effort to keep it up to date. Everything used to be in one file and assign `window` variables... Horrors!

SyntaxHighlighter is currently used and has been used in the past by Microsoft, Apache, Mozilla, Yahoo, Wordpress, Bug Labs, Freshbooks and many many other companies and blogs.
